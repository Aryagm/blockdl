# BlockDL Layer Documentation

Welcome to BlockDL's comprehensive neural network layer documentation! This educational resource provides detailed explanations, best practices, and implementation guidance for building deep learning models.

## Overview

BlockDL is a visual neural network builder that makes deep learning accessible through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Each layer type is carefully designed to provide both simplicity for beginners and flexibility for advanced users.

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is integrated directly into the BlockDL interface. Each layer and category includes educational links that bring you to relevant sections of this guide.

### Layer Categories

#### Input/Output Layers
Learn about how data enters and exits your neural network, including shape considerations and data preprocessing.

#### Dense Layers
Understand fully connected layers, their role in feature learning, and when to use them in your architecture.

#### Convolutional Layers
Explore convolutional operations, filters, and their applications in computer vision tasks.

#### Pooling Layers
Discover downsampling techniques and their impact on feature maps and computational efficiency.

#### Activation Functions
Master non-linear transformations and their crucial role in deep network expressiveness.

#### Regularization Techniques
Learn about preventing overfitting through dropout, batch normalization, and other regularization methods.

### Best Practices

1. **Layer Ordering**: Start with input layers, build feature extraction layers, and end with appropriate output layers
2. **Parameter Selection**: Choose layer parameters based on your data characteristics and model requirements
3. **Architecture Design**: Design networks that balance model capacity with computational efficiency
4. **Regularization**: Apply appropriate regularization techniques to improve generalization

### Common Patterns

- **Classification Networks**: Input â†’ Feature Extraction â†’ Dense â†’ Output
- **Convolutional Networks**: Input â†’ Conv/Pool blocks â†’ Flatten â†’ Dense â†’ Output  
- **Regularized Networks**: Include BatchNormalization and Dropout between layers
